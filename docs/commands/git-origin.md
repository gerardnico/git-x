% git-origin(1) Version ${VERSION} | git-origin

# git-origin

## DESCRIPTION

Shows:

* the remotes (ie normally the origin)
* the commit integration status with the upstream (ahead/behind) with the count and list
* the GitHub actions run status

We choose `origin` instead of `remote` because `o` as alias was still available and not `r` (`reset`)
