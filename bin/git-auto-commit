#!/bin/bash
# @name git-auto-commit
# @description
#
#    A commit utility function for `Git Add, Commit and Push`
#
#    Before the commit, these command checks if there is no remote commit
#    to integrate. If this is the case, it will execute a `git auto-pull`
#
#    # EXAMPLE
#
#    * For one repository with an automatically generated message from the files in the commit
#
#    ```bash
#    git auto-commit
#    ```
#
#    * For all repositories under the repo home directory with `git exec`
#
#    ```bash
#    git exec auto-commit "My Commit Message"
#    ```
#
#    # SYNOPSIS
#
#    ```bash
#    git auto-commit [Commit Message]
#    ```
#    If the commit message is not given, it will be generated with the files in the commit.
#
#    ## TIP
#
#    You can add it as alias in your `~.gitconfig`
#    Example with `acp` that stands for `add, commit, push`
#    ```ini
#    [alias]
#       acp = "!git-auto-commit"
#    ```
